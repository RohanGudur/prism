I don't know just check the permissions once and I think default also works but I'm not sure I'll try pushing it doesn't work let you know
oh yeah I think that is correct

twilights go yeah I am doing it live
the only thing is it transcribes only what I am saying so that is one thing
I think you can change that you can literally change it from microphone to all sound I think yeah yeah yeah yeah it still transcribing that kind of crazy
literally Jo sound Mein a raha hai vah likh de raha hai han if you speak in other languages it will write that thing whatever it is in English write it at the same I don't think so that we can add or other we can import another translation library and change it before writing it
